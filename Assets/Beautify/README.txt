We recommend importing the asset in an empty project and run the Demo Scenes provided to get an idea of the overall functionality.
Read the documentation and experiment with the tool.

Later, you can import the asset into your project and remove the demo folder.

Hint: to use the asset, select your camera and add "Beautify" script to it.



Documentation/API reference
---------------------------
The PDF is located in the Documentation folder. It contains additional instructions and description about the asset, as well as some recommendations.

Future updates
--------------

All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Beautify will be eventually available on the Asset Store.
