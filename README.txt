This game was inspired by the countless nights spent playing Age of Empires 2 with my brothers on the Island Map, defending against the horde of invading AI. This is my Tiancai hackathon project/attempt to capture the spirit of that mode in a casual game for mobile devices. 

This game was built in Unity 3D version 2019.1.7f1 with Visual Studio Community and the C# programming language. The 3d voxel art style was created in Qubicle and Magica Voxel, with 2d UI elements created in Pixelmator.

All programming, design, and art done by Daniel Truong with a few exceptions imported through the Unity Asset Store:

DUSTYROOM
COLR – Coloring Redefined
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/colr-coloring-redefined-57591
I used this package to create the gradient skyboxes.

KRONNECT
Beautify
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/beautify-61730
I used this package for post processing effects to enhance the final image.
